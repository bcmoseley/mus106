In this final unit we finally begin incorporating the minor mode into our performance and dictation activities. By the end of the unit, you should also be able to transcribe a more complex melody—including dynamics, tempo, and other performance indications—for an instrument other than the piano. Finally, this unit includes functional progressions played at the piano, in any major or minor key.

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from chapters 17–24 of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear Training*, and from the Karpinski/Kram *Anthology.* 
 
 
##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit IV are divided into three categories: singing, dictation, and keyboard. Those with deadlines in Unit IV are listed below followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as “I can . . .”


###Singing Skills
1. **Perform a melody at sight in any major key while conducting.** Including leaps to ti and re acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (1x)    
2. **Perform a prepared melody in any major or minor key while conducting or accompanying yourself.**; Including leaps to 2 or 7 acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Compound and simple duple, triple, or quadruple time; Quadruple divisions of the beat. (2x)   
3. **Perform a melody at sight in any major or minor key while conducting.** Including leaps to 2 or 7 acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Compound and simple duple, triple, or quadruple time; Quadruple divisions of the beat. (2x)  
4. **At medium speed (ca. quarter = 80), perform the minor-key sequentials.** See *MET*, pp. 79-80 and 89. (1x) 
  

### Dictation Skills
1. **Transcribe a major or minor key played by an instrument other than the piano.** (2x) 
2. **Dictate a long melody in any major or minor key.** Including leaps to ti and re acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Compound and simple duple, triple, and quadruple; Quadruple divisions of the beat; 3 listens. (2x)  
3. **Detect errors in a long melody written in any major or minor key.** Including leaps to ti and re acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Compound and simple duple, triple, and quadruple; Quadruple divisions of the beat; 1 listen. (1x)  

### Keyboard Skills
1. **Given any major or minor key, play tonic, dominant, and dominant seventh chords in any inversion.** (1x) 
2. **Given any major or minor key, play a specific functional T-D-T progression.** (1x)
