In Unit 2, we begin to negotiate staff notation in our performance and dictation activities, but in a very limited key context. Our goals are to be able to sing and dictate C major melodies, with leaps only to the tonic scale degrees 1, 3, and 5.

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from chapters 7-10 of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear Training*, and from the first two chapters of the Karpinski/Kram *Anthology.* Some additional resources are indicated below, taken from [Open Music Theory](http://www.openmusictheory.com).

##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit II are divided into three categories: singing, dictation, and keyboard. Those with deadlines in Unit II are listed below followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as “I can . . .”
**Unit Ends:** October 27  
**Last Day to Pass Objectives:** November 10

###Singing Skills
1. **Perform a prepared melody written in real notation while conducting or accompanying yourself.** Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; C major only. (2x)   
2. **Perform a melody at sight written in real notation while conducting.** Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; C major only. (2x) 
3. **At a medium speed (ca. quarter = 80), perform the major key pitch patterns written in real notation.** See *MET*, p. 39. (1x) 

### Dictation Skills
1. **Dictate a short melody (ca. 4 measures) in protonotation, then translate it to real notation.** Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, quadruple; C major; 2 listens. (2x)  
2. **Detect errors in a short melody written in real notation.** Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, quadruple; C major; 1 listen. (1x)  
3. **Dictate a longer melody (ca. 8 measures) in protonotation and translate to real musical notation.** C major; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; 3 listens. (2x) 

### Keyboard Skills
1. **Given a tonic, play any major scale ascending and descending.** See *TMM* workbook, Chapter 2, p. 19. (1x)  
2. **Given a tonic, play any version of the minor scale ascending and descending.** (1x)
