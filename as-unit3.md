In Unit 3 the keys in which we sing, dictate, and play piano are finally enlarge to encompass all fifteen major keys. By the end of the unit, you should also be able to sing and hear leaps to the dominant scale degrees 7 and 2, acting as neighbors to tonic. 

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from chapters 11-16 of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear Training*, and from the Karpinski/Kram *Anthology.* Some additional resources are indicated below, taken from [Open Music Theory](http://www.openmusictheory.com).

##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit III are divided into three categories: singing, dictation, and keyboard. Those with deadlines in Unit III are listed below followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as “I can . . .”

###Singing Skills
1. **Perform a prepared melody in any major key while conducting or accompanying yourself.** Primarily conjunct, occasional leaps to 1, 3, 5; Starting on any pitch; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (2x) 
2. **Perform a melody at sight in any one of the fifteen major keys while conducting.** Primarily conjunct, occasional leaps to 1, 3, 5; Starting on any pitch; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (2x) 
3. **Perform a prepared melody in any one of the fifteen major keys while conducting or accompanying yourself.** Including leaps to ti and re acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Starting on any pitch; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (2x)  
4. **At medium speed (ca. quarter = 80), perform the neighbor-note sequentials.** (*MET*, pp. 62-3). (1x) 

### Dictation Skills
1. **Dictate a long melody in any major key.** Primarily conjunct, occasional leaps to 1, 3, 5; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; 3 listens. (2x)

3. **Detect errors in a long melody written in any major key.** Including leaps to ti and re acting as neighbors; Potentially including chromatic lower neighbors; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; 2 listens. (1x)  

### Keyboard Skills
1. **Given a triad and inversion, play it at the piano.** (1x) 
2. **Given preparation, play a major key melody at the piano and transpose it to any named major key.** (1x)  
3. **Given a root, seventh chord type, and inversion, play it at the piano.** (1x)
