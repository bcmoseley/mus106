**Last Day to Pass Objectives:** March 4

Read all as “I can . . .”

<h3>Fundamentals</h3>
1. In chorale or keyboard style, **write a complete functional progression contain T-DP-D-T.** 
2. **Memorize the twelve Functional Linear Progressions.** Quickly identify them in a piece of music, and write a bass line with Roman numerals for any of them.
4. **Harmonize a melody or bass fragment** with an appropriate functional linear progression.
   
<h3>Music Analysis</h3>
1. **Create an analytical sketch** of a passage containing functional progressions, any type of dominant function chord, dominant preparation chords, and non-chord tones.
2. **Complete a multi-level analytical sketch** containing a Functional Linear Progression.
  
<h3>Composition</h3>
1. Harmonize a long melody with a Functional Linear Progression.
2. **Write a sentence for piano** whose basis is a Functional Linear Progression.
3. **Write a melodic period** for small ensemble whose basis is a Functional Linear Progression.
