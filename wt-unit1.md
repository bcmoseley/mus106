In Unit 1, your goal is to develop the ability to quickly identify and notate a variety of musical structures and relationships. Developing speed is absolutely essential. Every analytical and compositional task you attempt after this point is dependent on your ability to do these things, and without the ability to them quickly, those more interesting musical tasks will be far too time intensive.  
**Unit Deadline:** October 2  

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from the first three chapters of Smith's "*Tonal Models of Music*".  

##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit I are divided into two categories: fundamentals and music analysis. Read all as “I can . . .”

### Fundamentals
1. Quickly identify and notate pitches on all 4 clefs.  
2. Quickly identify and notate durations and durational relationships.    
3. Quickly identify and write any simple or compound intervals.   
4. Quickly identify and notate any major scale.  
5. Quickly identify and notate any harmonic minor scale.  
6. Quickly identify and notate any key signature.  
7. Quickly identify and notate any scale degree within a key.  
8. Quickly recognize the meter (simple/compound, duple/triple/quadruple) of a short musical excerpt from the musical notation and time signature.   
9. Provide a time signature in a notated passage without one.   
10. Correct the rhythmic notation for a passage of music, including adding beams, barlines, and rewriting durations and rests.  
   
### Music Analysis
1. Given pitch segments taken from a melody, identify the major and minor keys to which they belong.  
2. Given a melody or 2-part passage of music, with or without a key signature, identify the key and answer analytical questions regarding the music’s intervalic and scale-step content.  
3. Identify agogic and registral accents and, using that information, suggest a plausible meter for a passage without one.  
4. Analyze the metric structure of a passage, including syncopation and accentual accentual characteristics.
