In the final unit, there are less fundamental skills and more demanding compositional and analytical ones. One of the primary goals of this unit is attaing fluency with the system of analytical sketching developed in Smith's *Tonal Models of Music.* The final composition assignments are geared towards the composition of a complete phrase for piano and for string quartet.

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from chapters 7–9 of Smith's "*Tonal Models of Music*". Additional resources from [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com) are indicated below.  

##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit I are divided into three categories: fundamentals, music analysis, and composition. Read all as “I can . . .”

###Fundamentals
1. Quickly resolve any chord of dominant function, with or without a seventh, given a melody note or bass note.  
2. In four parts, write a complete functional progression, T-DP-D-T.  
   
###Music Analysis
1. Create an analytical sketch of a passage containing functional progressions, any type of dominant function chord, and non-chord tones.  
2. Create an analytical sketch of a passage containing functional progressions, any type of dominant function chord, dominant preparation chords, and non-chord tones.  

###Composition
1. Given a basic idea, write a complete melodic sentence and perform it.
2. Harmonize a melody with tonic and dominant (seventh) chords in a variety of inversions.
3. Write a melodic period and perform it.
