<p>Next week is going to be a busy week… We have to finish the FLP chapter, and you’ll be starting dictation assessments as well. In addition to getting ready for tutorials, a few things to work on this weekend:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the melody harmonization assignment I gave you in class.</li>
  <li>Beginning memorizing the FLP chart I passed out in class. I’d like you to know all of the common FLPs—that is, the ones with asterisks on the sheet. We’ll be using this knowledge a lot next week.</li>
  <li>If you haven’t already, please read pp. 3–10 in Chapter 10 of <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0">Smith’s TMM</a>. This has to do with sketching on <em>multiple levels</em>, which we’ll start doing next week.</li>
</ol>

<p>Happy weekend!</p>
