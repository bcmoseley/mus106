<p>Two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>For Friday</em>: Using the packet of score excerpts I gave you in class, label (with a bracket) every FLP that you can find. Remember that FLPs come in four basic varieties: 
 (a) prolonging tonic, e.g., T1-DP1-D7-T1; 
 (b) prolonging the motion from dominant to tonic, e.g., D5-D4-T3;
 (c) prolonging the motion from tonic to dominant, e.g., T1-D2-D5; 
 (d) prolonging the motion from dominant prep. to dominant, e.g., DP2-DP1-D7
 And that each of those varieties can take on a passing, neighboring, incomplete neighboring, and double neighboring shape.</p>

    <p>By the end of next week: Complete <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqr9cpmesyfs2au/FLP%20Melody%20Harmonization.pdf?dl=0">this melody harmonization assignment</a>. This will count both as the “melody harmonization” objective for this unit <em>and</em> as the T-DP-D-T fundamental objective. If you haven’t yet passed that quiz, this is your chance. I strongly recommend attempting this and showing it to me or to a TA to get feedback before turning it in.</p>
