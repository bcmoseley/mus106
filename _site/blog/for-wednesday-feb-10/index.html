<p>Today’s quizzes are graded and in the envelope outside of my door, and your gradebook has been update. Many of you still need to work on this skill. If you haven’t <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0_DrOo8gCUrYUZiSlRIc0Qzenc/preview">watched my video</a> from Friday and worked through the exercises in the workbook, <em>do that</em>!</p>

<p>Two things for Wednesday:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please complete the “Der Wanderer” sketch. I’ll certainly be taking those up to look them over, and on either Wednesday or Friday, I’ll give you a more extended assignment to satisfy the “DP sketch assessment.”</li>
  <li>Read pp. 10-16 of Smith’s Tonal Models of Music, Chapter 10. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0">Here’s a link to the Chapter.</a> As you read, please (1) try to figure out what a “linear progression” is and (2) keep a catalogue of specific linear progressions. This catalogue will be important as we move forward with the next set of assessment objectives.</li>
