<p>I’d like you to do two things for Friday:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Memorize the list of FLPs (functional linear progressions) that we learned in class. You should be able to tell me what kind of dominant chords will fit each of the dominant scale degrees in these patterns. We’ll have a quiz to see if you did this!</li>
  <li>In Smith’s <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0">Tonal Models of Music, Chapter 10</a>, read pp. 5–7, on multi-level sketching. Then, study his examples 10.12(a),(b), and (c). You don’t need to read the text surrounding them. Just look over the examples and try to figure them out. We’ll talk through this in class on Friday.</li>
</ol>

<p>Take a look at the new tutorial information for next week, in the box above.</p>
