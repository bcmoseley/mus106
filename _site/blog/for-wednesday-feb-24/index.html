<p>A few things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Complete the ‘multi-level sketch’ that we began in class. If you’re having trouble knowing what to do, there is lots of information in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0">Chapter 10 of <em>TMM</em></a>. You can learn a lot just by looking at the sketches in the chapter.</li>
  <li>Harmonize this melody. Once you’ve written a bass line, complete the inner voices in <em>chorale style.</em></li>
</ol>
