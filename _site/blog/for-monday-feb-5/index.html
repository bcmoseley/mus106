<p>We’ll start moving into Chapter 10 next week, which is concerned with “Functional Linear Progressions.” But first, we need to finish up the two objectives associated with Chapter 9.</p>

<ol>
  <li>If you didn’t pass the T-DP-D-T part-writing objective on Friday, you’ll have another chance on Monday. (After that, you need to plan to attempt this during <a href="/mus106/contact">office hours</a>.) See below for help!</li>
  <li>Each of you needs to be able to complete an analytical sketch involving DP chords. You should finish the sketching assignment we started Friday. We’ll do a bit more practice on Monday, and then I’ll give you an opportunity to pass the objective.</li>
</ol>

<p>For those of you that didn’t pass the assessment Friday (and you can check your gradebook to see), I made a video that walks through how I think about these part-writing exercises. I think it will be helpful and it’s short! Second, you should spend some of this weekend doing the remaining part writing exercises on pp. 137–140. You can find all of the answers to those exercises <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ny4dk43pmlcggxq/DP-D%20Part%20Writing%20Answer%20Key.pdf?dl=0">here</a>. These aren’t the only correct answers, but they all work.</p>
