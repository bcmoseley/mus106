###Course Materials  
The most current version of Smith's *Tonal Models of Music* is always available at [this Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/wvkux3zubehsze6/AABbxuaIp_1BKxNrTi6XDlZBa?dl=0).  

In addition, my in-development, open-source, and open-access textbook [Open Music Theory](http://www.openmusictheory.com) will be a helpful resource—in particular, the resources listed under ["Fundamentals"](http://openmusictheory.com/contents.html#fundamentals).
