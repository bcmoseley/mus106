A few things:

1. Complete the keyboard style harmonization of the passage we were working on in class. Remember, you are to do a realization for both the antecedent *and* the consequent phrases.

2. Work on the analytical sketching assignment that I gave you, which is due by the end of next week. Remember, if you give it to me early, I'll hand it back with feedback so that you can make corrections.

3. Don't forget to prepare for your tutorial, especially if you haven't yet passed the keyboard stuff from this past week.

Have a good weekend!
