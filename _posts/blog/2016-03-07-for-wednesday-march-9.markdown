Hi everyone. I've put your marked-up assignments outside of my office door. You have until Friday to make corrections!

A few things in the meantime:

1. Study and memorize the NFL chart we constructed in class, which is included below.
2. Complete the second half of your sentence, which we began in class. I've included my phrase below if you'd like to use that as a jumping off point.
