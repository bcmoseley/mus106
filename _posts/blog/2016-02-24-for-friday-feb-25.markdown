Two things:

1. *For Friday*: Using the packet of score excerpts I gave you in class, label (with a bracket) every FLP that you can find. Remember that FLPs come in four basic varieties: 
	(a) prolonging tonic, e.g., T1-DP1-D7-T1; 
	(b) prolonging the motion from dominant to tonic, e.g., D5-D4-T3;
	(c) prolonging the motion from tonic to dominant, e.g., T1-D2-D5; 
	(d) prolonging the motion from dominant prep. to dominant, e.g., DP2-DP1-D7
	And that each of those varieties can take on a passing, neighboring, incomplete neighboring, and double neighboring shape.
	
2. By the end of next week: Complete [this melody harmonization assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqr9cpmesyfs2au/FLP%20Melody%20Harmonization.pdf?dl=0). This will count both as the "melody harmonization" objective for this unit *and* as the T-DP-D-T fundamental objective. If you haven't yet passed that quiz, this is your chance. I strongly recommend attempting this and showing it to me or to a TA to get feedback before turning it in.
