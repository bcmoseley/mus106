We're going to take the suspension fundamentals quiz tomorrow. To pratice, work through [these exercises](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vc10e76pxgctavb/%20Exercises%20I.13%20pp%20263%E2%80%934%20%235%E2%80%936.pdf?dl=0). Before getting started, remind yourself of the consonance/dissonance and metrical components of the "preparation," "suspension," and "resolution."
