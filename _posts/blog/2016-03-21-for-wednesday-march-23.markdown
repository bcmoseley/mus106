We are getting ready for the fundamentals quizzes for this unit and the first set of assignments. To that end:

1. You should work on memorizing the NFLS chart that I gave you in class Monday. You don't need to memorize the entire chart—though that would be helpful—but you should certainly try to memorize all of the asterisck-ed examples. You'll have a "fill-in-the-chart" component to the quiz on Wednesday.
2. As more practice: If you haven't yet completed the treasure hunt, do that! And bring it to class on Wednesday.
3. On the treasure hunt sheet, I'd like you to do a multi-level sketch of the first Haydn example, in A major.
