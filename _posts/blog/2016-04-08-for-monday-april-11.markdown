A few things to work on this weekend for next week. First, if you haven't passed the NFLS Sketching skill, you need complete the new assignment I handed out in class today. (Download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/t4vz944ytdhwlhi/NFLS%202%20Sketch.pdf?dl=0).) Much of what I saw on many of your first attempts was just a bit of laziness with the symbols! **This is due Monday.**

Second, you need to attempt the melody harmonization assignment I gave you. (Download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7nms508fy5p2zuu/NFLS%3ASequence%20Assignment.pdf?dl=0).) As always, I highly recommend letting me take a look at how its going before you turn it in. **Due by Wednesday.** 

And third, the last assignment for this unit!, get started on the sequence sketching assignment. (Download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5zw7yil7pjq6n20/Sequence%20Sketch%201.pdf?dl=0).) **Due Friday.**
