Sorry for the late update. You should be working on three projects, detailed below. I'm going to extend the deadline for these projects to next Monday, March 7. But, you really should plan to turn some of these things in *early* so that you can get feedback and, if necessary, try the assignment again.

1. The [melody harmonization assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqr9cpmesyfs2au/FLP%20Melody%20Harmonization.pdf?dl=0) that I posted Wednesday. As I mentioned this will also satisfy the T-DP-D-T fundamentals quiz if you haven't yet passed that.
2. The [sketch assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9twlvs10o1jc5m/FLP%20Sketch.pdf?dl=0).
3. And the [composition assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0kun6742fgue8vi/FLP%20Composition%20Assignment.pdf?dl=0).

As regards the composition, I've made a short video for you guys to help you get started. Here it is:
