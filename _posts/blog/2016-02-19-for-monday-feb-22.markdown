Next week is going to be a busy week... We have to finish the FLP chapter, and you'll be starting dictation assessments as well. In addition to getting ready for tutorials, a few things to work on this weekend:

1. Complete the melody harmonization assignment I gave you in class. 
2. Beginning memorizing the FLP chart I passed out in class. I'd like you to know all of the common FLPs—that is, the ones with asterisks on the sheet. We'll be using this knowledge a lot next week.
3. If you haven't already, please read pp. 3–10 in Chapter 10 of [Smith's TMM](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0). This has to do with sketching on *multiple levels*, which we'll start doing next week.

Happy weekend!
