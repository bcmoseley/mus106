Sorry about missing class yesterday!

Tomorrow, we'll have a short practice quiz to see how prepared you are for the first fundamental's assessment, which will happen on Friday or Monday. On that assessment, you'll have to write (in chorale or keyboard style) chord progressions that move from various DP chords to D chords. 

To prepare:  

1. If you haven't already done the workbook assignment that I asked you to complete for Monday, please do that!

2. I'd like you to *skim* Chapter 9 ([Text](https://www.dropbox.com/s/us3w2m5wihafm66/chapter_9_text.pdf?dl=0) and [Examples](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2ae01jissvrh03d/chapter_9_examples.pdf?dl=0)) for information about ii6, ii6/5, IV6, and ii4/2. Don't read the whole chapter. Just look for information about these chords. What sorts of generalizations can you make?

Finally, I made a short video (below) that you should watch before tomorrow. It's an introduction to the keyboard tutorial that you'll have to attempt next week.
