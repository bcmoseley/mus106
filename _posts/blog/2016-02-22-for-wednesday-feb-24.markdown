A few things:

1. Complete the 'multi-level sketch' that we began in class. If you're having trouble knowing what to do, there is lots of information in [Chapter 10 of *TMM*](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0). You can learn a lot just by looking at the sketches in the chapter.
2. Harmonize this melody. Once you've written a bass line, complete the inner voices in *chorale style.*
