Today's quizzes are graded and in the envelope outside of my door, and your gradebook has been update. Many of you still need to work on this skill. If you haven't [watched my video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0_DrOo8gCUrYUZiSlRIc0Qzenc/preview) from Friday and worked through the exercises in the workbook, *do that*!  

Two things for Wednesday:

1. Please complete the "Der Wanderer" sketch. I'll certainly be taking those up to look them over, and on either Wednesday or Friday, I'll give you a more extended assignment to satisfy the "DP sketch assessment."
2. Read pp. 10-16 of Smith's Tonal Models of Music, Chapter 10. [Here's a link to the Chapter.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oaxjhuw7zf0eym6/chapter_10_text.pdf?dl=0) As you read, please (1) try to figure out what a "linear progression" is and (2) keep a catalogue of specific linear progressions. This catalogue will be important as we move forward with the next set of assessment objectives.
