Alright, we're nearing the end of the first unit and for the next week or so, all of you have a series of small assignments that you'll need to complete to satisfy all of [the objectives for this unit](/mus106/wt-unit1). Here's a summary of what you should be working on this weekend. You should have *all* of these things turned in by next Friday; though, if I were you, I would aim to have some of them completed earlier. 

1. The [melody harmonization assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vqr9cpmesyfs2au/FLP%20Melody%20Harmonization.pdf?dl=0) that I posted Wednesday. As I mentioned this will also satisfy the T-DP-D-T fundamentals quiz if you haven't yet passed that.
2. The [sketch assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r9twlvs10o1jc5m/FLP%20Sketch.pdf?dl=0) I handed out in class today. We'll do some sketching practice on Monday, so you might wait to start this until after class.
3. And the [composition assignment](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0kun6742fgue8vi/FLP%20Composition%20Assignment.pdf?dl=0) I handed out in class today as well. I'll hand back your string quartet projects Monday so that you can get some feedback, but all of you should be ready to do this now.
