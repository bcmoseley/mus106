Our goals for this unit are to become fluent in performing and dictating simple melodies and rhythms using protonotation. Protonotation is designed to facilitate performance without the complications of staff notation. We'll use it during this unit and into the next as you gain fluency with standard notation in the written theory course.  
**Unit Ends:** September 24  
**Last Day to Pass Objectives:** October 8

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from the first six chapters of Gary Karpinski's *Manual for Ear Training*. Some additional resources are indicated below, taken from an [online text book I am writing](http://www.openmusictheory.com).

##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit I are divided into three categories: singing, dictation, and keyboard. Those with deadlines in Unit I are listed below followed by the number of successful assessment attempts that will be required to officially demonstrate mastery (grade of P). Read all as “I can . . .”

###Singing Skills
1. **Perform a prepared melody written in prototonation while conducting**. Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (2x) 
2. **Perform a melody at sight written in prototonation while conducting**. Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple. (2x)   
3. **At a medium speed (ca. quarter = 80), perform the major key pitch patterns written in solfege.** See *MET*, p. 10. (1x) 

### Dictation Skills
1. **Using protonotation, dictate the rhythm of a passage**. Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; 2 listens. (2x)   
2. **Using solfege syllables, dictate the pitch content of short  melodies (ca. 4 measures long).** Primarily conjunct with occasional leaps to 1, 3, or 5; Simple duple, triple, and quadruple; 2 listens. (2x) 
3. **Given a melody written in protonotation, detect pitch and rhythm errors.** 1 listen. (1x)  

### Keyboard Skills
1. **At a medium tempo, play a series of 12 pitches written in treble, alto, tenor, and bass clef while matching the pitches with your voice.** See *TMM* workbook, Chapter 1, p. 8, B1. (1x) 
2. **Given a random pitch, identify it by citing at least two different, enharmonically equivalent letter-names.** See *TMM* workbook, Chapter 1, p. 8, B2. (1x) 
3. **Given a random pitch and interval, play the pitch and interval above and below it, while matching the pitches with your voice.** (1x)
