		<li>You'll have to play I–V(7)–I progressions in <em>any</em> major or minor key, using each of these three melodic scale degree patterns: 3-2-1, 1-7-1, and 3-4-3.</li>
		<li>You'll have to sight-sing a melody that highlights the dominant triad. In addition to the practice you're doing in class, you can find additional exercises in the Karpinski anthology, Chapter 25.</li>
