<h4>Tutorials Next Week</h4>
<p>There are no tutorials next, but you can start preparing for the following week. You'll have to play I–V(7)–I progressions in *any* major or minor key. There are three melodic scale degree patterns you should use: 3-2-1, 1-7-1, and 3-4-3.</p>  
<p>If you haven't yet signed up for a tutorial time, do that as soon as possible!</p>
