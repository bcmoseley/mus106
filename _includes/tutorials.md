<h4>Tutorials (Feb. 15 and 16)</h4>

		<li>For those of you that haven't passed the first keyboard skill: you'll have to play I–V(7)–I progressions in <em>any</em> major or minor key, using each of these three melodic scale degree patterns: 3-2-1, 1-7-1, and 3-4-3. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0_DrOo8gCUrOUVwMDhrTkMyMHM/preview">Here's my video</a> walking through this skill.</li>
		<li>Everyone will have to sight-sing a melody that highlights leaps to 4 and 6. In addition to the practice you're doing in class, you can find additional exercises in the Karpinski anthology, Chapter 26. And if you haven't passed the first sight-singing objective, you'll have to try that first.</li>
