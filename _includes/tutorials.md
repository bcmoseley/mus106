<h4>Tutorials (March 28 and 29)</h4>
<p>
	There are no tutorials on Monday so that you can work on your written theory work. But you can start planning ahead to the following week. You'll need to be able to harmonize 3-2-1 or 1-2-3 with a leading-tone chord. The TAs will also assign some sight-singing.
