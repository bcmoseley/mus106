In Unit 2, we continue to work towards fluency with a core set of music fundamentals. In addition we will complete some interesting analytical exercises and composition exercises, most geared towards stylistic melody composition and harmonization.

##Materials  
We will primarily use materials from chapters 4-6 of Smith's "*Tonal Models of Music*". Additional resources, most taken from my online textbook [*Open Music Theory*](http://www.openmusictheory.com) are indicated below.  
 
##Concepts and Skills  
The specific concepts and skills we will cover and assess (according to the N/A/P grading scale outlined on the assessment guide) in Unit I are divided into three categories: fundamentals, music analysis, and composition. Read all as “I can . . .”

### Fundamentals 
1. Quickly identify and notate any melodic minor scale. 
2. Quickly identify and resolve tendency tones in any key. 
3. In any key, write two-voice authentic and half cadences. 
4. Quickly identify and notate any major, minor, diminished, or augmented triad. 
5. Quickly identify and notate any triad with a Roman numeral and figured bass symbol. 
6. Write T/1-D-5-T/1 cadences in any key, without or without 7ths. 

### Music Analysis
1. Analyze a continuo part with figured bass symbols.  
2. Create an analytical sketch of a passage containing functional progressions.  

### Composition
1. Given a cantus firmus, compose a first species counterpoint against it—both above and below—and perform it with a partner. In major and minor.
