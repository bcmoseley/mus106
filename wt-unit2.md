**Last Day to Pass Objectives:** April 8

Read all as “I can . . .”

### Fundamentals 
1. **Memorize the ten common Non-functional Linear Successions.** Quickly identify them in a piece of music, and write a bass line with Roman numerals for any of them.
2. **Harmonize a melody or bass fragment** with an appropriate Non-functional Linear Succession.
3. **Memorize and write a bass line** for any of the five common types of diatonic sequence.

### Music Analysis
1. **Complete a multi-level analytical sketch** containing a Non-Functional Linear Succession. 
2. **Complete a multi-level analytical sketch** containing a diatonic sequence.

### Composition
1. **Harmonize a long melody** with a Non-Functional Linear Succession.
2. **Write a sequential “contrasting middle.”**
